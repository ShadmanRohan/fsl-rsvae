# Generating Representative Samples for Few-Shot Classification

This repository contains the code for [Generating Representative Samples for Few-Shot Classification]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04390](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02918.pdf)).



A large body of the code is borrowed from "A new meta-baseline for few-shot learning". Thanks!
